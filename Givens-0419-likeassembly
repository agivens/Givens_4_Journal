The jumps in Human Resource Machine and assembly are very similar to each 
other. In both, there is a general jump and a specialized jump. The general
jump in both the computing language and the game jumps to wherever the code
dictates. The specialized jump is somewhat different in the language and in 
the game. In the game, the specialized jump checks if the number is negative
or if the number is a zero. In the programming language, the specialized loop
checks the value of the number against another value.
