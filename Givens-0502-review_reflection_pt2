To write a 2D array you first specify the type of array, like int or char, 
type two sets of empty brackets, name the array, type new and the type again, 
then two sets of brackets filled with the length of the array in each. To write 
a 3D array, you do everything just like a 2D array except change the number of 
brackets from 2 to 3. To change the value for the third value in a one 
dimensional array, you type:
grid[2] = 'x';
To write a while loop, you type while with parenthesis next to it, with open 
curly brackets next to the parenthesis. Inside the parenthesis you place the
conditions for the while loop. Inside the brackets you place the code you want 
to run while the conditions are true/false. You use while loops in the game to 
insure the game ends when the player loses/wins. You call the method by typing
the name of the method with parenthesis next to it. Inside the parenthesis you
type the information needed for the method to work. it was recommended to use
.toLowercase because the scanner doesn't understand capital letters if 
lowercase letters are specified. You call the methods at different times to
separate the actions. You separate the actions to show the changes at each 
step of the process. You will pass the player and enemy positions across 
methods. You pass them between methods because numerous methods need them to 
move them and determine if they occupy the same space. You pass them between 
methods by making the values public.
