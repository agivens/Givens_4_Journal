In mymap[67][43], 67 is the x coordinate and 43 is the y coordinate. This is 
because an array is set up like a coordinate pair, so the x value comes first.
#a:if (i=0){ 
       System.out.print("8888"); #a
   }
Prints 8888 if i(the x value) is equal to 0.
#b:else {
       System.out.print(map[i][j]); #b
   }
This prints the map.
#c:if (map[i][j] != 'x') {
        System.out.println("."); #c
   }
This code prints a '.' if the space doesn't contain a 'x'.
#d:else {
      System.out.println(map[i][j]); #d
   }
This prints the map.
You can use the boolean to set the conditions for the while loop. For example,
if you set up a while loop to stop the game after an enemy is incountered it
would look something like this:
keepplaying = true;
while(keepplaying) {
	playersalive();
}
Static means the value cannot be altered.
