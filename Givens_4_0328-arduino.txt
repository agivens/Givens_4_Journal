The code commenting is the same, but what are called classes in Java are 
called functions in the variant of C. The arduino's code affects physical 
circuits and components, where as Java creates a program that creates 
something on the computer screen. A circuit needs a power source, an object
being affected , like a light or button, and wires connected to the circuit 
and grounding it. One project I completed last week made a light dim or 
brighten depending on how much pressure you put on the sensor. That was one of 
the first times accepting user input using an arduino in the examples provided.
