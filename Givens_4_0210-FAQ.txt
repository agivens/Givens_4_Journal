I only had one problem when adding orbs to the game, and the problem didn't
involve the orb code. The problem centered around my map. A couple of
problems I probably could see if I could test it would be:

1: making the orb move with my character
2: creating the hitbox
3: making the orb disappear when the hitbox intersects with my enemy
4: making the orb visible at all
5: making the orb appear when the spacebar is hit
