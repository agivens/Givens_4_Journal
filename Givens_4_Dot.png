A [label="You find yourself standing in the lobby of a three floored building.
What do you do? Do you stay on the Ground Floor, or travel to another floor?"]
B [label="You stay on the Ground Floor. Do you stay inside and see what happens
or venture outside the building?"]
C [label="You are in the elevator. Which floor do you go to? Second, Third, or
Top floor?"]
D [label="You stay inside the building. You now have time to really look around
at your surroundings. You notice the building looks very old. Just as you come
to that conclusion, you fall through the floor into the borded up basement.
You broke your neck. BAD END"]
E [label="You are brave and venture outside the building. It's dark and you 
can't see a thing. You wander in the void outside for eternity. BAD END"]
F [label="The elevator stops on the second floor. It's dark and you can't see
anything ahead of you. If you squint you can see three doors. Which door do you
choose: one, two, or three?"]
G [label="The elevator stops on the third floor. A long hall stretchs before 
you. The lights are flickering on and off, but provide enough light to see 
something move at the end of the hall. There is a door to the right of the 
elevator. Do you investigate the movement or explore the door next to the 
elevator?"]
H [label="The elevator stops on the top floor. The doors open and you are 
immediately blinded by a bright light. Do you fumble for another button or 
follow the wall and feel your way around on the top floor?"]
I [label="You enter door number one. It's the doorway to the staircase. You
walk down and discover a small group of people living down at the bottom.
They explain that outside the door is a void and they are the only people
left. You live out the remainder of your life with your new friends. GOOD END"]
J [label="You enter door number two. It's the door to a fully furnished
apartment. A cat is already living there. There is a supply of food and water
big enough to last a lifetime. You and your feline friend live out the
remainder of your lives there, losing a bit of your sanity each day. OKAY END"]
K [label="You enter door number three. A man is inside with a bloody syringe.
He attacks you and you are unable to fight him off. BAD END"]
L [label="You wander down the hall to find out what moved. A mad man stabs
you with a bloody syringe. BAD END"]
M [label="You explore the door next to the elevator. It's the doorway to the 
staircase. You walk down and discover a small group of people living down at 
the bottom. They explain that outside the door is a void and they are the only 
people left. You live out the remainder of your life with your new friends. 
GOOD END."]
N [label="You hit a random button on the elevator panel. You get transported
to the basement. You find the door is borded up. Do you ram it or find 
something to break the door down?"]
O [label="You wander around, feeling your way across the floor. The wood has 
rotted away at a section of the floor. You fall through the gap. BAD END"]
P [label="You ram the door down. A rabbid dog is waiting inside. It attacks
you. Because you cannot defend yourself, you don't survive the encounter.
BAD END"]
Q [label="You find a beam that must have fallen. You use it to break down the 
door and leap inside the doorway as it collapses behind you. A rabbid dog, who
was inside attacks you. You mange to fend it off. Because you are trapped,
you eventually die of starvation. BAD END"]
