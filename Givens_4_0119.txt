I created a maze which you have to escape from before the enemy finds you. The
blocked variable to stop you from walking through walls wasn't functioning 
correctly. I almost finished before the break. I just had so many reviews to 
do, I spent my time reviewing and completing my reviews for other classes. I
was behind the timeline for most of the week because I missed Monday and 
had to catch up.
