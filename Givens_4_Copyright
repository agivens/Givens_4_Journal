Questions:

I haven't seen this license before. I haven't noticed it anywhere. This license says 
the program is free to redistribute and/or modify under the terms of the license.
You would use this license when you want to allow users to modify the program. You
would not use this license when you want the software to stay the way it is, no
modifications or redistributions allowed.
